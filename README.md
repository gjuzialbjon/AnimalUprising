# Project Description :
Animal Uprising is an 2D Adventure/Strategy game. In the game, your purpose is to crush the base of the ultimate enemy of the animals, Mankind. You’ll be able to control a certain animal hero and fight alongside with your animal allies which you summon with gold. Our hero is going to have skills which can be learned after gaining a level point and equipment bought with gold.
